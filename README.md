# Vaccination-App
App built in C++ using the Qt framework that facilities the acces, editing and viewing of a certain database. 
The database was created using Microsoft SQL Server and any information is purely fictional.
In order to log in you have to enter the following credentials:
      
      Account : SA
      Password: sametypeofstand 13
      
 These can be changed from the function "void PaginaPrincipala::on_pushButton_clicked()" (Line 128) or disabled from Line 32 where you just hide it and show the rest.
 In some cases the Db string might be changed too.
 Have fun!
